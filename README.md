# Boston House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices in Boston using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. It contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts.

## Code Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)

## Usage
To train the model and evaluate its performance, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
4. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
5. Use the trained model for prediction by running the `predict.py` script.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using the `evaluate.py` script.

## Results
The performance metrics of the trained model, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score, are available in the evaluation reports generated by the `evaluate.py` script.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or add new features are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
